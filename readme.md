# GTDLBench

## Abstract

With its effective and wide real applications, deep learning attracts great attention nowadays. Many deep learning frameworks emerged to facilitate deep learning research, development and applications. However, few research has been conducted to effectively measure these frameworks. And it still remains a critical task on choosing the optimal framework for specific deep learning models and applications. GTDLBench aims at introducing a hybrid benchmark to systematically measure the performance of these deep learning frameworks as well as the potential performance of different hardware devices. The performance metrics derived from both deep learning and systems field are introduced to present an easy and holistic approach for deep learning benchmarking.


## Metrics

* Training Time (s)
* Testing Time (s)
* Accuracy (%)
